# Paper Gen
I wanted to print my own dot grid paper but didnt like how most of the online premades have a watermark.
So instead of using other scripts on github and learning to install another programming language, i made my own in python :P
This script took inspiration from [ckpwong's papergen](https://github.com/ckpwong/papergen), ie paper types.

This Script generates a full sheet, unlike ckpwong's papergen which allows to split the page into partitions.

Default size is A4. See -h or --help for more information on the available options.
